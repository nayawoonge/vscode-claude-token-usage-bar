# Claude Token Usage Bar

**English** · [한국어](https://github.com/nayawoonge/vscode-claude-token-usage-bar/blob/main/README.ko.md)

A tiny VS Code extension that shows your **Claude Code context-window usage** and **today's token consumption** in one status bar item.

The item turns **yellow** when the context window drops below 25% free and **red** below 10%, so you get a warning before you run out of room. Both parts live in a **single status bar item**, so nothing (Copilot, encoding, Ln/Col…) can wedge between them.

**Hover** the item for a mini dashboard: the current session's context window (used / remaining / model) plus every project's total token usage as a bar chart.

> **What about my plan's remaining quota?** That isn't available to any extension — Claude Code's `/usage` command is interactive-only and the subscription allowance isn't exposed anywhere a script can read. Run `/usage` inside Claude Code, or check the [Console](https://platform.claude.com/usage). This extension shows *context room* and *today's consumption*, not remaining plan quota.

## How it works

- **Context** — reads the newest Claude Code session for your current project and shows how full its context window is. The window size is detected from the session's model automatically (e.g. Opus 4.8 = 1M tokens, Haiku 4.5 = 200k).
- **Today** — sums all tokens processed today across your sessions, as a running consumption figure.

> These are local estimates and may drift after a Claude Code update.
